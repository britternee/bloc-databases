2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: If we need to save a finite set of information, a text file could be fine. A database allows us to efficiently retrieve data. We can manipulate the data from a database. We can inject and use it where necessary. We can create reports. So if we just want to store data, a text file could work. If we want to USE data, a database is the way to go.


3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: SQL is a declarative language, rather than a procedural language. With SQL, we don't have to worry about telling our computer HOW to get the information we need. We use SQL to let the computer know WHAT we need. This actually reminds me a bit of React. However, in general when we use a language such as JavaScript, we are writing out exact instructions (functions) on HOW we want the computer to perform our request.


4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A: A database uses a table structure to display and store data. It has columns that define what the data represents and rows that represent a set of related data in the table. Each intersection of a column and row is a cell which holds a value, which is a piece of information representing that data.


5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A: 
Table: Collection of related data held in a structured format. Consists of columns and rows.
Row: Represents a set of related data in a table. 
Column: Set of data values of a particular type, one value for each row in a table
Value: A piece of information at the intersection of a row and column


6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

A: Integers, strings, float
